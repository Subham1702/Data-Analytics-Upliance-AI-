## Data Analysis Report - User Behavior, Cooking Preferences, and Order Trends ##

### Project Overview ###

This project analyzes user behavior, cooking preferences, and order trends datasets. The primary goal is to uncover insights about user demographics, popular dishes, and spending patterns to guide marketing strategies and improve customer engagement.

### Datasets Used ###

a) UserDetails - Contains demographic data, favorite meals, and order history.

b) CookingSessions - Logs cooking session details, including ratings and durations.

c) OrderDetails - Tracks order details, including status, amounts, and ratings.

### Analysis Objectives ###

- Clean and merge the datasets to create a comprehensive view of user behavior.

- Identify popular dishes based on order frequency.

- Analyze the relationship between cooking sessions and user orders.

- Explore demographic factors (age, location) influencing user preferences.

- Visualize trends to support business recommendations.

### Key Findings ###

- #### Popular Dishes:
   ``` Python
chart1 = BarChart()
data = Reference(ws, min_col=12, min_row=2, max_row=17, max_col=12)
categories = Reference(ws, min_col=12, min_row=2, max_row=17)
chart1.add_data(data, titles_from_data=True)
chart1.set_categories(categories)
chart1.title = "Top Ordered Dishes"
ws.add_chart(chart1, "Z2")
```

'Spaghetti' and 'Caesar Salad' are the most frequently ordered dishes.
